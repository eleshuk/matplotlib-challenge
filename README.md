### Working with mice study data to identify effective drug regimens for fighting skin cancer. 

## Objectives:
  #### - Generate a summary statitstics table of tumor volume for each drug regimen. 
  #### - Plot mice per treatment regimen.
  #### - Plot distribution of female and male mice in the study.
  #### - Plot final tumor volume for each mouse across the most promising treatment regimens.
  #### - Plot and identify potential outliers.
  #### - Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.
  #### - Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
  #### - Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. 
  #### - Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
  #### - Look across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data.
